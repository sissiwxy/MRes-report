abstract = {Signatures of photon localization are observed in a constellation of transport phenomena which reflect the transition from diffusive to localized waves. The dimensionless conductance, g, and the ratio of the typical spectral width and spacing of quasimodes, $\backslash$delta, are key indicators of electronic and classical wave localization when inelastic processes are absent. However, these can no longer serve as localization parameters in absorbing samples since the affect of absorption depends upon the length of the trajectories of partial waves traversing the sample, which are superposed to create the scattered field. A robust determination of localization in the presence of absorption is found, however, in steady-state measurements of the statistics of radiation transmitted through random samples. This is captured in a single parameter, the variance of the total transmission normalized to its ensemble average value, which is equal to the degree of intensity correlation of the transmitted wave, $\backslash$kappa. The intertwined effects of localization and absorption can also be disentangled in the time domain since all waves emerging from the sample at a fixed time delay from an exciting pulse, t, are suppressed equally by absorption. As a result, the relative weights of partial waves emerging from the sample, and hence the statistics of intensity fluctuations and correlation, and the suppression of propagation by weak localization are not changed by absorption, and manifest the growing impact of weak localization with t.},

abstract = {Artificial Neural Networks are computational network models inspired by signal processing in the brain. These models have dramatically improved the performance of many learning tasks, including speech and object recognition. However, today's computing hardware is inefficient at implementing neural networks, in large part because much of it was designed for von Neumann computing schemes. Significant effort has been made to develop electronic architectures tuned to implement artificial neural networks that improve upon both computational speed and energy efficiency. Here, we propose a new architecture for a fully-optical neural network that, using unique advantages of optics, promises a computational speed enhancement of at least two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art and three orders of magnitude in power efficiency for conventional learning tasks. We experimentally demonstrate essential parts of our architecture using a programmable nanophotonic processor.},

abstract = {While the problem of the multiple scattering of particles by a random distribution of scatterers has been treated classically through the use of the Boltzmann integro-differential equation, the corresponding problem of the multiple scattering of waves seems to have received scant attention. All previous treatments have considered the problem in the "geometrical optics" limit, where the rays are regarded as trajectories of particles and the treatment for particles is then applied, so that the interference phenomena in wave scattering are neglected. In this paper the problem of the multiple scattering of scalar waves by a random distribution of isotropic scatterers is considered in detail on the basis of a consistent wave treatment. The introduction of the concept of "randomness" requires averages to be taken over a statistical ensemble of scatterer configurations. Equations are derived for the average value of the wave function, the average value of the square of its absolute value, and the average flux carried by the wave. The second of these quantities satisfies an integral equation which has some similarities to the corresponding equation for particle scattering. The physical interpretation of the results is discussed in some detail and possible generalizations of the theory are outlined.},

abstract = {Quantum state preparation in high-dimensional systems is an essential requirement for many quantum-technology applications. The engineering of an arbitrary quantum state is, however, typically strongly dependent on the experimental platform chosen for implementation, and a general framework is still missing. Here we show that coined quantum walks on a line, which represent a framework general enough to encompass a variety of different platforms, can be used for quantum state engineering of arbitrary superpositions of the walker's sites. We achieve this goal by identifying a set of conditions that fully characterize the reachable states in the space comprising walker and coin, and providing a method to efficiently compute the corresponding set of coin parameters. We assess the feasibility of our proposal by identifying a linear optics experiment based on photonic orbital angular momentum technology.},

abstract = {We give new evidence that quantum computers -- moreover, rudimentary quantum computers built entirely out of linear-optical elements -- cannot be efficiently simulated by classical computers. In particular, we define a model of computation in which identical photons are generated, sent through a linear-optical network, then nonadaptively measured to count the number of photons in each mode. This model is not known or believed to be universal for quantum computation, and indeed, we discuss the prospects for realizing the model using current technology. On the other hand, we prove that the model is able to solve sampling problems and search problems that are classically intractable under plausible assumptions. Our first result says that, if there exists a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the same probability distribution as a linear-optical network, then P{\^{}}{\#}P=BPP{\^{}}NP, and hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. Unfortunately, this result assumes an extremely accurate simulation. Our main result suggests that even an approximate or noisy classical simulation would already imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. For this, we need two unproven conjectures: the "Permanent-of-Gaussians Conjecture", which says that it is {\#}P-hard to approximate the permanent of a matrix A of independent N(0,1) Gaussian entries, with high probability over A; and the "Permanent Anti-Concentration Conjecture", which says that |Per(A)|{\textgreater}=sqrt(n!)/poly(n) with high probability over A. We present evidence for these conjectures, both of which seem interesting even apart from our application. This paper does not assume knowledge of quantum optics. Indeed, part of its goal is to develop the beautiful theory of noninteracting bosons underlying our model, and its connection to the permanent function, in a self-contained way accessible to theoretical computer scientists.},

abstract = {Anderson localization is an interference effect crucial to the understanding of waves in disordered media. However, localization is expected to become negligible when the features of the disordered structure are much smaller than the wavelength. Here we experimentally demonstrate the localization of light in a disordered dielectric multilayer with an average layer thickness of 15 nanometers, deep into the subwavelength regime. We observe strong disorder-induced reflections that show that the interplay of localization and evanescence can lead to a substantial decrease in transmission, or the opposite feature of enhanced transmission. This deep-subwavelength Anderson localization exhibits extreme sensitivity: Varying the thickness of a single layer by 2 nanometers changes the reflection appreciably. This sensitivity, approaching the atomic scale, holds the promise of extreme subwavelength sensing. A nderson localization is the cornerstone of modern understanding of waves in dis-ordered media (1–3). The formation of local-ized states, first predicted for electrons, has been studied in a variety of wave systems and has inspired an exceptionally rich domain of research (4–17). The study of Anderson local-ization has historically focused on disorder in systems with " large " spatial features (wavelength-scale or larger): Although the effect of very fine disorder on localization is described in the liter-ature, it is commonly understood to be orders of magnitude weaker than in ordinary Anderson localization. This scenario is encountered for elec-tromagnetic radiation. For wavelengths much larger than the typical feature size, the localiza-tion length diverges with asymptotically increasing wavelengths, l (4, 18). This decrease in the im-pact of disorder in the subwavelength regime is by no means unique to Anderson localization. Indeed, it is generally believed that the impact on transport of any type of photonic structure, whether disordered or not, should wash out when the features are in the deep-subwavelength regime; rather, light should behave as though traveling through a homogeneous material, with an " effec-tive medium " index of refraction (19). But this is not always the case—it was recently shown that simple periodic structures can show major de-viations from the effective medium prescription (20, 21). This breakdown of effective medium theory was predicted to be particularly pro-nounced for disordered structures, where even l=1000 structural variations can exert a dominant influence (22). Here we demonstrate Anderson localization of light in a random stack of deep-subwavelength dielectric layers. Na{\"{i}}vely, we would expect the role of nanophotonic disorder to be negligible, but the localization we observe is actually very strong, with localization lengths on the order of l. The disorder in our experiment is thickness variations in layers with ∼l=40 thickness. We show how a 2-nm variation in just one of these layers is measurable. Moreover, although both Anderson localization and evanescence inhibit transmission separately, we show that transmis-sion mediated by localized modes can be enhanced by as much as two orders of magnitude. All these results occur in the vicinity of the critical angle, q c , and are intimately related to the presence of an exceptional point there. Our disordered multilayer structures are deposited on a rutile prism whose index of refrac-tion (n TiO2 ∼ 2:6) is larger than the (calculated) effective medium of the multilayer stack (Fig. 1A). Consequently, there exists a critical angle q c above which light, in the effective medium picture,},

The purpose of this paper is to introduce a master equation for two-sided optical cavities with spontaneous photon emission. To do so, we use the same notion of photons as in linear optics scattering theory and consider a continuum of traveling-wave cavity photon modes. Our model predicts the same stationary state photon emission rates for the different sides of a laser-driven optical cavity as classical theories. Moreover, it predicts the same time evolution of the total cavity photon number as the standard standing-wave description in experiments with resonant and near-resonant laser driving.

abstract = {Excitations in complex media are superpositions of eigenstates that are referred to as 'levels' for quantum systems and 'modes' for classical waves. Although the Hamiltonian of a complex system may not be known or solvable, Wigner conjectured that the statistics of energy level spacings would be the same as for the eigenvalues of large random matrices. This has explained key characteristics of neutron scattering spectra. Subsequently, Thouless and co-workers argued that the metal-insulator transition in disordered systems could be described by a single parameter, the ratio of the average width and spacing of electronic energy levels: when this dimensionless ratio falls below unity, conductivity is suppressed by Anderson localization of the electronic wavefunction. However, because of spectral congestion due to the overlap of modes, even for localized waves, a comprehensive modal description of wave propagation has not been realized. Here we show that the field speckle pattern of transmitted radiation--in this case, a microwave field transmitted through randomly packed alumina spheres--can be decomposed into a sum of the patterns of the individual modes of the medium and the central frequency and linewidth of each mode can be found. We find strong correlation between modal field speckle patterns, which leads to destructive interference between modes. This allows us to explain complexities of steady state and pulsed transmission of localized waves and to harmonize wave and particle descriptions of diffusion.},

abstract = {Hybrid photonic integration combines complementary advantages of different material platforms, offering superior performance and flexibility compared with monolithic approaches. This applies in particular to multi-chip concepts, where components can be individually optimized and tested. The assembly of such systems, however, requires expensive high-precision alignment and adaptation of optical mode profiles. We show that these challenges can be overcome by in situ printing of facet-attached beam-shaping elements. Our approach allows precise adaptation of vastly dissimilar mode profiles and permits alignment tolerances compatible with cost-efficient passive assembly techniques. We demonstrate a selection of beam-shaping elements at chip and fibre facets, achieving coupling efficiencies of up to 88{\%} between edge-emitting lasers and single-mode fibres. We also realize printed free-form mirrors that simultaneously adapt beam shape and propagation direction, and we explore multi-lens systems for beam expansion. The concept paves the way to automated assembly of photonic multi-chip systems with unprecedented performance and versatility.},

Mixture, resulting from noise, is often an unwanted result of interaction with an environment, but is also of fundamental interest, and is proposed to play a role in some biological processes. Here we report an integrated waveguide device that can generate and completely characterize pure two-photon states with any amount of entanglement and arbitrary single-photon states with any amount of mixture. The device consists of a reconfigurable integrated quantum photonic circuit with eight voltage controlled phase shifters. We demonstrate that for thousands of randomly chosen configurations the device performs with high fidelity. We generate maximally and non-maximally entangled states, violate a Bell-type inequality with a continuum of partially entangled states, and demonstrate generation of arbitrary one-qubit mixed states.},

Traditional machine learning has dramatically improved the benchmarking and control of experimental quantum computing systems, including adaptive quantum phase estimation and designing quantum computing gates. On the other hand, quantum mechanics offers tantalizing prospects to enhance machine learning, ranging from reduced computational complexity to improved generalization performance. The most notable examples include quantum enhanced algorithms for principal component analysis, quantum support vector machines, and quantum Boltzmann machines. Progress has been rapid, fostered by demonstrations of midsized quantum optimizers which are predicted to soon outperform their classical counterparts. Further, we are witnessing the emergence of a physical theory pinpointing the fundamental and natural limitations of learning.

The continuous spectrum of spatial modes of the system is derived, and the electromagnetic field is quantized in terms of a continuous set of mode creation and destruction operators. Coherent state and squeezed vacuum-state excitations of the field are characterized by energy flow, or intensity, variables. The determination of small changes in the cavity length by observations of fringe intensity is considered for schemes in which the cavity is simultaneously excited by coherent and squeezed vacuum-state inputs. The contributions to the limiting resolution from photocount and radiation-pressure length uncertainties are evaluated. These properties of the Fabry-Perot cavity are compared with the corresponding results for the Michelson interferometer.},

abstract = {One of the most interesting phenomena in solid-state physics is Anderson localization, which predicts that an electron may become immobile when placed in a disordered lattice. The origin of localization is interference between multiple scatterings of the electron by random defects in the potential, altering the eigenmodes from being extended (Bloch waves) to exponentially localized. As a result, the material is transformed from a conductor to an insulator. Anderson's work dates back to 1958, yet strong localization has never been observed in atomic crystals, because localization occurs only if the potential (the periodic lattice and the fluctuations superimposed on it) is time-independent. However, in atomic crystals important deviations from the Anderson model always occur, because of thermally excited phonons and electron-electron interactions. Realizing that Anderson localization is a wave phenomenon relying on interference, these concepts were extended to optics. Indeed, both weak and strong localization effects were experimentally demonstrated, traditionally by studying the transmission properties of randomly distributed optical scatterers (typically suspensions or powders of dielectric materials). However, in these studies the potential was fully random, rather than being 'frozen' fluctuations on a periodic potential, as the Anderson model assumes. Here we report the experimental observation of Anderson localization in a perturbed periodic potential: the transverse localization of light caused by random fluctuations on a two-dimensional photonic lattice. We demonstrate how ballistic transport becomes diffusive in the presence of disorder, and that crossover to Anderson localization occurs at a higher level of disorder. Finally, we study how nonlinearities affect Anderson localization. As Anderson localization is a universal phenomenon, the ideas presented here could also be implemented in other systems (for example, matter waves), thereby making it feasible to explore experimentally long-sought fundamental concepts, and bringing up a variety of intriguing questions related to the interplay between disorder and nonlinearity.},

abstract = {A theory is presented for the frequency dependence of the power spectrum of photon current fluctuations originating from a disordered medium. Both the cases of an absorbing medium (``grey body'') and of an amplifying medium (``random laser'') are considered in a waveguide geometry. The semiclassical approach (based on a Boltzmann-Langevin equation) is shown to be in complete agreement with a fully quantum mechanical theory, provided that the effects of wave localization can be neglected. The width of the peak in the power spectrum around zero frequency is much smaller than the inverse coherence time, characteristic for black-body radiation. Simple expressions for the shape of this peak are obtained, in the absorbing case, for waveguide lengths large compared to the absorption length, and, in the amplifying case, close to the laser threshold.},

Hyperentangled photon states (i.e. states showing entanglement in multiple DOFs) have demonstrated significant implications for both fundamental physics tests and quantum communication and computation. Increasing the number of qubits of photonic experiments requires miniaturization and integration of the basic elements and functions to guarantee the set-up stability. This motivates the development of technologies allowing the precise control of different photonic DOFs on a chip. We demonstrate the contextual use of path and polarization qubits propagating within an integrated quantum circuit. We tested the properties of four-qubit linear cluster states built on both DOFs.

abstract = {Quantum walks, in virtue of the coherent superposition and quantum interference, possess the exponential superiority over its classical counterpart in applications of quantum searching and quantum simulation. A straitforward physical implementation involving merely photonic source, linear evolution network and detection make it very appealing, in light of the stringent requirements of universal quantum computing. The quantum enhanced power is highly related to the state space of quantum walks, which can be expanded by enlarging the dimension of evolution network and/or photon number. Increasing photon number is considerably challenging due to probabilistic generation of single photons and multiplicative loss. Here we demonstrate a two-dimensional continuous-time quantum walk by using the external geometry of photonic waveguide arrays, rather than inner the degree of freedom of photons. Using femtosecond laser direct writing, we construct a large-scale three-dimensional structure which forms a two-dimensional lattice with up to 49X49 nodes on a photonic chip. We demonstrate the quantum transport properties via observing the ballistic evolution pattern and the variance profile, which agree well with simulation results for quantum walks. We further reveal the transient nature of the walk from our implementation, suggesting a higher dimension. An architecture that allows free evolvement in all directions and large scale, combing with defect and disorder control, may bring up powerful and versatile quantum walk machines for classically intractable problems.},

Within this description the disorder strength -- and hence the localization characteristics -- depends strongly on the wavelength of the incident light. In an alternative description in analogy to sound waves in a material with spatially fluctuating elastic moduli this is not the case. Here, we report on an experimentum crucis in order to investigate the validity of the two conflicting theories using transverse-localized optical devices. We do not find any dependence of the observed localization radii on the light wavelength. We conclude that the modulus-type description is the correct one and not the potential-type one. We corroborate this by showing that in the derivation of the traditional, potential-type theory a term in the wave equation has been tacititly neglected. In our new modulus-type theory the wave equation is exact. We check the consistency of the new theory with our data using a field-theoretical approach (nonlinear sigma model).},

abstract = {Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society. Frequently cited examples include the cell, a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions, and the Internet, a network of routers and computers connected by physical links. While traditionally these systems have been modeled as random graphs, it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real networks are governed by robust organizing principles. This article reviews the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks, and the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.},

We consider both inhomogeneous dielectric resonators with a scalar dielectric constant {\$}\backslashepsilon({\{}\backslashbf r{\}}){\$} and cavities defined by mirrors of arbitrary shape. Using the Feshbach projector technique we quantize the field in terms of a set of resonator and bath modes. We rigorously show that the field Hamiltonian reduces to the system--and--bath Hamiltonian of quantum optics. The field dynamics is investigated using the input--output theory of Gardiner and Collet. In the case of strong coupling to the external radiation field we find spectrally overlapping resonator modes. The mode dynamics is coupled due to the damping and noise inflicted by the external field. For wave chaotic resonators the mode dynamics is determined by a non--Hermitean random matrix. Upon including an amplifying medium, our dynamics of open-resonator modes may serve as a starting point for a quantum theory of random lasing.},

Examples range from microscopy and nanosurgery to astronomy. In recent years, ongoing efforts have made the correction of spatial distortions possible by wavefront shaping techniques. However, when ultrashort pulses are employed scattering induces temporal distortions which hinder their use in nonlinear processes such as in multiphoton microscopy and quantum control experiments. Here we show that correction of both spatial and temporal distortions can be attained by manipulating only the spatial degrees of freedom of the incident wavefront. Moreover, by optimizing a nonlinear signal the refocused pulse can be shorter than the input pulse. We demonstrate focusing of 100fs pulses through a 1mm thick brain tissue, and 1000-fold enhancement of a localized two-photon fluorescence signal. Our results open up new possibilities for optical manipulation and nonlinear imaging in scattering media.},

For cavities with non-uniform index and/or non-uniform gain, the new basis set allows the steady-state lasing properties to be computed with much greater efficiency. This formulation of the SALT can be solved in the single-pole approximation, which gives the intensities and thresholds, including the effects of nonlinear hole-burning interactions to all orders, with negligible computational effort. The approximation yields a number of analytic predictions, including a "gain-clamping" transition at which strong modal interactions suppress all higher modes. We show that the single-pole approximation agrees well with exact SALT calculations, particularly for high-Q cavities. Within this range of validity, it provides an extraordinarily efficient technique for modeling realistic and complex lasers.},

abstract = {This thesis concerns the theoretical investigation of interference phenomena related to elastic and inelastic scattering of quantized light. The presented work is naturally divided into two parts, the first is concerning elastic scattering while the second explores inelastic scattering. In the first part we use a scattering-matrix formalism combined with results from random-matrix theory to investigate the interference of quantum optical states on a multiple scattering medium. We investigate a single realization of a scattering medium thereby showing that it is possible to create entangled states by interference of squeezed beams. Mixing photon states on the single realization also shows that quantum interference naturally arises by interfering quantum states. We further investigate the ensemble averaged transmission properties of the quantized light and see that the induced quantum interference survives even after disorder averaging. The quantum interference manifests itself through increased photon correlations. Furthermore, the theoretical description of a measurement procedure is presented. In this work we relate the noise power spectrum of the total transmitted or reflected light to the photon correlations after ensemble averaging. This analysis enables us to describe an experimental observation of the quantum nature of light that survives the averaging over disorder. In the second part we investigate inelastic scattering. This we do by first treating the scattering of light on dipoles embedded in an arbitrary dielectric environment. By considering the two different models for dipole interaction known as the minimal-coupling and electric-dipole interaction Hamiltonians, we find exact relations between the electric field and the dipole operators in the Heisenberg picture, while keeping the model of the dipoles arbitrary. Due to the exact treatment of the electric-field operators, we obtain kernels known from classical scattering theory to describe the propagation of the field from the dipoles. Using the found electric field operators we derive the Heisenberg equations of motion for the dipoles while treating them as quantum two-level systems and using the Born–Markov and rotating-wave approximations. Postponing the rotating-wave approximation to the very end of the formal calculations allows us to identify the different physical parameters of the dipole evolution in terms of physical quantities known from optics. Finally, we use our Heisenberg picture formalism to treat a dilute cloud of two-level atoms, by simplifying the equations of motion using a single-scattering approximation for the interaction between the atoms. This enables us to derive expressions for the steady-state population and fluorescence spectrum, where we find cooperative effects in both the elastic and the inelastic spectra.},

The effect finds its origin in the interference of electrons that have undergone multiple scattering by defects in the solid2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

abstract = {Synchronization of an ensemble of oscillators is an emergent phenomenon present in several complex systems, ranging from social and physical to biological and technological systems. The most successful approach to describe how coherent behavior emerges in these complex systems is given by the paradigmatic Kuramoto model. This model has been traditionally studied in complete graphs. However, besides being intrinsically dynamical, complex systems present very heterogeneous structure, which can be represented as complex networks. This report is dedicated to review main contributions in the field of synchronization in networks of Kuramoto oscillators. In particular, we provide an overview of the impact of network patterns on the local and global dynamics of coupled phase oscillators. We cover many relevant topics, which encompass a description of the most used analytical approaches and the analysis of several numerical results. Furthermore, we discuss recent developments on variations of the Kuramoto model in networks, including the presence of noise and inertia. The rich potential for applications is discussed for special fields in engineering, neuroscience, physics and Earth science. Finally, we conclude by discussing problems that remain open after the last decade of intensive research on the Kuramoto model and point out some promising directions for future research.},

The protocol that we design appears to be remarkably robust against both the actual value taken by the coin parameter and strong dephasing-like noise acting on the spatial degree of freedom.

abstract = {Science is not merely the smooth progressive interaction of hypothesis, experiment and theory, although it sometimes has that form. More realistically the scientific study of any given complex phenomenon generates a number of explanations, from a variety of perspectives, that eventually requires synthesis to achieve a deep level of insight and understanding. One such synthesis has created the field of out-of-equilibrium statistical physics as applied to the understanding of complex dynamic networks. Over the past forty years the concept of complexity has undergone a metamorphosis. Complexity was originally seen as a consequence of memory in individual particle trajectories, in full agreement with a Hamiltonian picture of microscopic dynamics and, in principle, macroscopic dynamics could be derived from the microscopic Hamiltonian picture. The main difficulty in deriving macroscopic dynamics from microscopic dynamics is the need to take into account the actions of a very large number of components. The existence of events such as abrupt jumps, considered by the conventional continuous time random walk approach to describing complexity was never perceived as conflicting with the Hamiltonian view. Herein we review many of the reasons why this traditional Hamiltonian view of complexity is unsatisfactory. We show that as a result of technological advances, which make the observation of single elementary events possible, the definition of complexity has shifted from the conventional memory concept towards the action of non-Poisson renewal events. We show that the observation of crucial processes, such as the intermittent fluorescence of blinking quantum dots as well as the brain's response to music, as monitored by a set of electrodes attached to the scalp, has forced investigators to go beyond the traditional concept of complexity and to establish closer contact with the nascent field of complex networks. Complex networks form one of the most challenging areas of modern research overarching all of the traditional scientific disciplines. The transportation networks of planes, highways and railroads; the economic networks of global finance and stock markets; the social networks of terrorism, governments, businesses and churches; the physical networks of telephones, the Internet, earthquakes and global warming and the biological networks of gene regulation, the human body, clusters of neurons and food webs, share a number of apparently universal properties as the networks become increasingly complex. Ubiquitous aspects of such complex networks are the appearance of non-stationary and non-ergodic statistical processes and inverse power-law statistical distributions. Herein we review the traditional dynamical and phase-space methods for modeling such networks as their complexity increases and focus on the limitations of these procedures in explaining complex networks. Of course we will not be able to review the entire nascent field of network science, so we limit ourselves to a review of how certain complexity barriers have been surmounted using newly applied theoretical concepts such as aging, renewal, non-ergodic statistics and the fractional calculus. One emphasis of this review is information transport between complex networks, which requires a fundamental change in perception that we express as a transition from the familiar stochastic resonance to the new concept of complexity matching.},

abstract = {We predict a new spatial quantum correlation in light propagating through a multiple scattering random medium. The correlation depends on the quantum state of the light illuminating the medium, is infinite in range, and dominates over classical mesoscopic intensity correlations. The spatial quantum correlation is revealed in the quantum fluctuations of the total transmission or reflection through the sample and should be readily observable experimentally.},

abstract = {Arguments are presented that the T=0 conductance G of a disordered electronic system depends on its length scale L in a universal manner. Asymptotic forms are obtained for the scaling function $\beta$(G)=dlnGdlnL, valid for both G≪Gc≃e2ℏ and G≫Gc. In three dimensions, Gc is an unstable fixed point. In two dimensions, there is no true metallic behavior; the conductance crosses over smoothly from logarithmic or slower to exponential decrease with L., This article appears in the following collection:},

@article{Gnutzmann2006,
abstract = {During the last years quantum graphs have become a paradigm of quantum chaos with applications from spectral statistics to chaotic scattering and wave function statistics. In the first part of this review we give a detailed introduction to the spectral theory of quantum graphs and discuss exact trace formulae for the spectrum and the quantum-to-classical correspondence. The second part of this review is devoted to the spectral statistics of quantum graphs as an application to quantum chaos. Especially, we summarise recent developments on the spectral statistics of generic large quantum graphs based on two approaches: the periodic-orbit approach and the supersymmetry approach. The latter provides a condition and a proof for universal spectral statistics as predicted by random-matrix theory.},
