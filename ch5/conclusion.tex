\chapter{Conclusion and outlook}

In this report, we have ...

further work...

--simulation:

-better scaling

-level spacing

-include phase, not just intensity

-scattering matrix

-other geometries e.g. trees

-tuning

-more on time-response/pulse stuff

--experiment:

-get coupling to work, possibly try e.g. \cite{Dietrich2018}.

-then we can work on observing reliable effects to compare with theory
