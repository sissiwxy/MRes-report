\begin{acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor Dr.Riccardo Sapienza, whose guidance and support have been invaluable in navigating this very interdisciplinary project. I would also like to thank the rest of the group for their help and discussions, particularly Tahiyat and Stefano for getting me started in the lab, and Michele, Alexis and Dhruv for introducing the theory and answering my questions. Dr.Steve Kolthammer kindly offered helpful discussions on the quantum aspects of the project. Acknowledgement is due to Michele Gaio for building the MATLAB library used for simulations in this report, and Fred Gardes at ORC Southampton for fabricating the network samples.

This project wouldn't have been possible without the support of the CQD CDT faculty and staff throughout the year: Prof.Ben Sauer, Prof.Richard Thompson, Dr.Steve Kolthammer, Prof.Myungshik Kim, Miranda Smith and Naho Ollason. Finally I would like to thank the rest of CQD cohort 9, whose company and friendship made my time at Imperial College all the more fun.
