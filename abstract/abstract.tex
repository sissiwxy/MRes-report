\begin{abstract}

This project studies a novel nanophotonic system, namely complex waveguide networks, as a potential platform for quantum light state synthesis and engineering. This report focuses on light transport behaviours through such networks using numerical simulation. We introduce a theoretical model for describing light on complex networks; starting from classical electromagnetic waves, this model is then extended to include bosonic fields, i.e. quantised light. Simulations are then constructed using this theory to investigate transport phenomena. We focus on the effect of coherent multiple scattering, and how disorder and randomness in the networks leads to localisation. Classical transport and quantum interference effects are compared. Finally, we present some preliminary progress in measuring light transport through complex networks in the lab.
